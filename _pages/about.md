Susheng Wu is a PhD candidate at the Software Engineering Lab, Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Bihuan Chen.
Prior to this, he earned his bachelor's degree in cybersecurity from Sichuan University in 2022.  

His research interests focus on Software Security, Software Supply Chain (AI4SE), LLM Supply Chain (SE4AI).
He was the awardee of the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at FSE 2024.

Research Interests
======
- Software Security: The software system is vulnerable to security issues. We are interested in but not limited to topics such as software vulnerability detection/management/mitigation, and privacy protection. Our goal is to identify potential security risks and prevent the leakage of sensitive privacy information (e.g., LLM privacy).

- Software Supply Chain (AI4SE): Software systems are inherently complex. Achieving a clear assessment of security, maintenance, and legal risks in the software supply chain , along with developing effective mitigation strategies, remains a significant challenge. Our mission is to simplify this process by providing comprehensive evaluations and actionable solutions that enhance security and compliance throughout the lifecycle of software systems.

- AI Supply Chain (SE4AI): The AI systems (e.g., model, dataset, code, plugins) suffers from the similar risks but by the different root causes. We aim to evaluate and mitigate the risks in AI throughout the lifecycle of software systems.
